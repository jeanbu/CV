## Skills

(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

#### Design and UX

Working on my website at Blubale, using Figma I designed a new UI with a simple and intuitive layout so users can book tours and activities. That not only made the website faster but also easier to use, which increased conversion rate dramatically. My website is: https://www.blubale.com/en/

#### Data-driven

I've run a few websites as a freelancer, and I always pay close attention to analytics, to understand what works and what could be improved easily bringing the most impact. At the start of the pandemic, I enrolled on a few data science and statistical courses to improve this skill.
